            My name is Måns Andersson. I am a software engineer based in Stockholm, Sweden.
            I have a passion for technology, I like building cool things, and I am always trying to learn more and improve.<br/>
            When I am not behind the desk I could be found lifting weights, climbing, skiing or reading.

        <p class="text-gray-800 pt-3 text-sm">
            2+ years of professional development expreience.<br/><br/>
            My first software-related job was teaching others how to code.
            This was a great experience and I enjoy trying to make seemingly complex things easier for others
            to understand.<br/>
            Now I work as a Software Engineer at Keyfactor,
            building PKI products to help secure all kinds of IT infrastructures.

        <h1 class="text-gray-800 font-sans font-bold text-3xl mt-8">Skills</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-800 pt-3 text-sm">
          In my professional career I have worked mostly with back-end development, primarily in Java and Python.
          From my master's degree in computer science I have a good foundation of CS, math and software engineering knowledge.<br/><br/>
          Front-end development and design is something I have pursued mostly on my own time.
          One result of those efforts is the webpage that you are currently on.
          The technologies I've worked the most with is React and Tailwind.<br/><br/>
