	In my professional career I have worked mostly with back-end development, primarily in Java and
	Python. From my master's degree in computer science I have a good foundation of CS, math and
	software engineering knowledge.<br /><br />
	Front-end development and design is something I have pursued mostly on my own time. One result of those
	efforts is the webpage that you are currently on. The technologies I've worked the most with is React
	and Tailwind.<br /><br />
