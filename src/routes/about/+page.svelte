  My name is MÃ¥ns Andersson. I am a software engineer based in Stockholm,
  Sweden. I have a passion for technology, I like building cool things, and I am
  always trying to learn and improve.<br />
  When I am not behind the desk I can be found lifting weights, climbing, skiing
  or reading.

  My first software-related job was teaching others how to code. This was a great
  experience and I enjoy trying to make seemingly complex things easier for others
  to understand.<br />
  Currently I work as a Full-stack Engineer at Quickbit, building modern payment solutions
  based on blockchain technology.

  The majority of professional has been back-end development. I am familiar with
  writing business logic, designing RESTful endpoints, and working with ORM:s to
  handle data. Most of by back-end work has been with Java and Python.<br /><br
  />

  In my full-stack work, I have also evolved my front-end skills. Working with
  TypeScript, React and doing A/B testing. The website you are currently on, is
  built with Svelte and Tailwind.<br /><br />

  From my master's degree in computer science I have a good foundation of CS,
  math and software engineering knowledge.
