	<!-- 2+ years of professional development expreience.<br /><br /> -->
	My first software-related job was teaching others how to code. This was a great experience and I enjoy
	trying to make seemingly complex things easier for others to understand.<br />
	Now I work as a Full-stack Engineer at Quickbit, building modern payment solutions based on blockchain technology.

<p class="text-gray-800 pt-3 text-sm">
	The majority of professional has been back-end development.
	I am familiar with writing business logic, designing RESTful endpoints, and working with ORM:s to handle data.
	Most of by back-end work has been with Java and Python.<br/><br/>

	In my full-stack work, I have also evolved my front-end skills. Working with TypeScript, React and doing A/B testing.
	The website you are currently on, is built with Svelte and Tailwind.<br/><br/>

	From my master's degree in computer science I have a good foundation of CS, math and
	software engineering knowledge.
