			EJBCA is one of the longest running CA software projects, providing time-proven robustness,
			reliability and flexibitlity. EJBCA is platform independent and can easily be scaled out to
			match the needs of your PKI requirements. EJBCA is based on Java and Jakarta and runs in a
			Wildfly application server, but is also available as a container. I have worked on EJBCA since
			2022, EJBCA Community Edition is open-source and available on Github. EJBCA Enterprise Edition
			is available only to paying customers.
